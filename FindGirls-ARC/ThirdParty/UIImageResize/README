Created a git repo for Trevor Harmon's UIImage resize category.
http://vocaro.com/trevor/blog/2009/10/12/resize-a-uiimage-the-right-way/

Currently two branches. Master is the file posted on Trevor's blog, without any changes (yet).
The other branch, Standalone removes dependencies on the other UIImage categories on Trevor's blog (e.g. the rounded corners category)

If you just need to resize images, check out Standalone, if you're going to use rounded corners, checkout master.
